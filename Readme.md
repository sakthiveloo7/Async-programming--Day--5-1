# Random Advice Generator


This project is a simple web application that generates random pieces of advice. It uses JavaScript to fetch advice from an external API and display it on the webpage.

## Usage

To use the random advice generator, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Click the "Get Advice" button to generate a new random advice.

## Demo

You can see a live demo of the random advice generator [here](https://your-demo-link.com).

## How It Works

The random advice generator works by making a GET request to the Advice Slip JSON API (https://api.adviceslip.com/). The API returns a random piece of advice in JSON format, which is then parsed and displayed on the webpage.
